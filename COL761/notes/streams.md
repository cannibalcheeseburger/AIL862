## Detailed Explanation of the Slides on Data Streams

**Data Streams: Motivation and Challenges**

- In real-world data mining, data often arrives continuously and rapidly (as a *stream*) rather than as a fixed dataset. Examples include live traffic data, social media feeds, surveillance footage, and search queries.
- These streams are typically *infinite* and *non-stationary* (their properties can change over time), making it impossible to store the entire stream for processing.

---

## The Stream Model

- Data arrives as *tuples* at high speed, possibly from multiple sources.
- The system has limited memory and cannot store all incoming data.
- The main challenge: How to compute meaningful statistics or summaries using only limited memory?

## Maintaining a Fixed-Size Sample (Reservoir Sampling)

**Problem:**  
- You want to keep a random sample $$ S $$ of exactly $$ s $$ tuples from a stream, but you cannot store all the data.

**Naive solution:**  
- Store all $$ n $$ seen tuples and pick $$ s $$ at random-impractical for large or infinite streams.

**Reservoir Sampling Algorithm:**  
1. Store the first $$ s $$ elements in $$ S $$.
2. For each subsequent element (the $$ n $$-th element, where $$ n > s $$):
    - With probability $$ s/n $$, include the new element in $$ S $$, replacing a randomly chosen existing element.
    - Otherwise, discard the new element.
- **Guarantee:** After seeing $$ n $$ elements, each has a probability $$ s/n $$ of being in the sample.

**Proof (by induction):**
- Base case: After $$ s $$ elements, all are in the sample ($$ s/s = 1 $$).
- Inductive step: When the $$ n+1 $$-th element arrives, the probability that any previous element stays in the sample is calculated to ensure the property holds for $$ n+1 $$.

## Filtering Data Streams: Membership Queries

**Scenario:**  
- Given a large set $$ S $$ (e.g., known good email addresses), determine if a stream element belongs to $$ S $$.
- $$ S $$ is too large to store in memory.

**First Cut Solution:**  
- Use a bit array $$ B $$ of size $$ n $$ (e.g., 1 GB = 8 billion bits).
- Hash each member of $$ S $$ to a bit in $$ B $$ and set it to 1.
- To check if a stream element $$ a $$ is in $$ S $$, hash $$ a $$ and check if the corresponding bit is 1.
- **Downside:** False positives are possible (an element not in $$ S $$ may hash to a bit set by another element), but no false negatives (if in $$ S $$, always detected).

**False Positive Rate Analysis:**  
- Probability a bit remains 0 after $$ m $$ insertions: $$ (1 - 1/n)^m $$.
- Probability a bit is 1: $$ 1 - (1 - 1/n)^m \approx 1 - e^{-m/n} $$ as $$ n \to \infty $$.
- For 1 billion addresses and 8 billion bits: fraction of 1s ≈ 0.1175 (11.75%).

## Bloom Filters: Improving Membership Testing

- Use $$ k $$ independent hash functions.
- For each element in $$ S $$, set $$ k $$ bits (one per hash function) in $$ B $$.
- To test membership, check all $$ k $$ bits for the stream element.
- **False positive probability:** $$ (1 - e^{-km/n})^k $$.
    - For $$ k=1 $$: 0.1175
    - For $$ k=2 $$: 0.0493
- Bloom filters dramatically reduce false positives compared to a single hash function.

## Top-k and Frequent Elements in Data Streams

**Definitions:**
- *Frequent element*: Occurs more than a threshold ($$ \varphi N $$) in the stream.
- *Top-k elements*: The $$ k $$ most frequent elements.

**Exact solution:**  
- Requires $$ O(\min(N, A)) $$ space, where $$ N $$ is stream size and $$ A $$ is alphabet size-impractical for large streams.

## Space-Saving Algorithm (for Approximate Top-k/Frequent Elements)

**How it works:**
- Maintain a summary of $$ m $$ elements (with their counts and possible error).
- For each incoming element:
    - If already monitored, increment its count.
    - If not, replace the element with the minimum count, set its count to min+1, and record the error as the previous min count.
- The sum of all counts equals the total number of items seen.

**Accuracy Properties:**
- If an element’s true frequency exceeds the minimum count, it is guaranteed to be in the summary.
- The count for each element is an upper bound; the error indicates the maximum possible overestimation.

**Frequent Elements Query:**
- Any element whose (Count - error) > $$ \varphi N $$ is guaranteed to be frequent.

**Top-k Query:**
- Any element whose (Count - error) ≥ Count$$_{k+1}$$ is guaranteed to be in the top-k.

**Example:**  
- For $$ N=73, m=8, \varphi=0.15 $$, elements with (Count - error) > 11 are guaranteed frequent.

## When Does the Space-Saving Algorithm Work Well?

- **Works well:** When the data follows a *power law* (few elements are very frequent).
- **Does not work well:** When frequencies are uniform (no clear "heavy hitters").
