## Detailed Explanation of the Slides: Vision Transformers (ViT)

These slides introduce Vision Transformers (ViT), a deep learning architecture for image classification that adapts the transformer model-originally designed for natural language processing-to computer vision tasks. Below, each major concept from the slides is explained in detail, with additional context from reliable sources for enhanced understanding.

### **Global Context & Self-Attention**

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture local spatial relationships in images using convolutional filters. In contrast, transformers use **self-attention** to model relationships between all parts of the input, enabling a global view of the data. This is particularly useful for tasks where understanding the entire context of an image is important.

#### **Self-Attention Mechanism**

- **Purpose:** Allows each element (patch) of the input to attend to every other element, capturing global dependencies.
- **Implementation:** The provided code shows a PyTorch implementation of self-attention, where the input is normalized, projected into queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V), and then attention scores are computed as scaled dot products between Q and K. The scores are normalized with softmax, used to weight V, and finally projected back to the original dimension[1][6].
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, enhancing its ability to capture diverse relationships[6].

### **Image as a Sequence: Patch Embedding**

Instead of processing an image pixel-by-pixel or via convolutions, ViT splits the image into **fixed-size patches** (e.g., 16x16 pixels). Each patch is flattened and linearly embedded into a vector, treating patches as "tokens" similar to words in a sentence[3][4].

- **Patchify:** Divide an image of size $$H \times W$$ into patches of size $$P \times P$$, resulting in $$N = (H \times W) / P^2$$ patches.
- **Embedding:** Each patch is flattened and projected into a high-dimensional space via a linear layer, forming the input sequence for the transformer[3][5].

---

### **Positional Embedding**

Transformers lack an inherent sense of order; they treat all tokens equally regardless of their position. To address this, **positional embeddings** are added to each patch embedding, encoding spatial information so the model can distinguish between different locations in the image[4][6].

- **Learned Positional Embeddings:** These are trainable vectors added to the patch embeddings, ensuring the model is aware of the relative positions of patches[4].

---

### **Transformer Encoder**

The core of ViT is a **stack of transformer encoder layers**. Each layer consists of:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Captures relationships between all patches.
- **Feed-Forward Network (MLP):** Applies non-linear transformations to each patch embedding.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections:** Improve training stability and gradient flow[6].
- **Depth:** The number of such layers (e.g., 12 in ViT-Base, 24 in ViT-Large, 32 in ViT-Huge)[1].

---

### **Classification Token ("CLS" Token) and Output**

A special **classification token** (`cls_token`) is prepended to the sequence of patch embeddings. After processing through the transformer layers, the output corresponding to this token is used for classification via a fully connected layer[3].

- **Pooling:** Some variants use mean pooling over all patch outputs instead of the CLS token.

### **Model Variants and Scaling**

ViT comes in different sizes:

| Model     | Layers | Heads | Params |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| ViT-Base  | 12     | 12    | 86M    |
| ViT-Large | 24     | 16    | 307M   |
| ViT-Huge  | 32     | 16    | 632M   |

Larger models have more layers and attention heads, enabling them to learn more complex representations but requiring more data and computational resources[1][5].

---

### **Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning**

- **Pre-Training:** ViT models are often pre-trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet, ImageNet-21K, JFT-300M) to learn general visual features[1].
- **Fine-Tuning:** The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Performance improves with larger pre-training datasets, especially for bigger ViT models[1].

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **ViT treats images as sequences of patches, similar to words in NLP.**
- **Self-attention enables global context modeling, unlike local convolutions in CNNs.**
- **Positional embeddings provide spatial information.**
- **The architecture scales well with data and model size, but large datasets are crucial for best performance.**
