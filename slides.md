Absolutely! Here’s a detailed, slide-by-slide script for a 10-minute presentation based on the research paper “ProS: Prompting-to-simulate Generalized Knowledge for Universal Cross-Domain Retrieval.” This script incorporates all key points, including those you may have missed, and is structured for clarity and engagement.

## **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Script:**  
Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! Today, I’ll be presenting the research paper titled “ProS: Prompting-to-simulate Generalized Knowledge for Universal Cross-Domain Retrieval,” published at CVPR 2024. This paper proposes a novel prompt-based framework for tackling the challenging task of universal cross-domain retrieval.

---

## **Slide 2: Introduction & Motivation**

**Script:**  
Let’s start with the motivation. In today’s digital world, we often need to search for relevant content across different domains. For example, finding similar items across photos, sketches, and cartoons. This is called Universal Cross-Domain Retrieval, or UCDR.  
UCDR is challenging because of two main reasons:  
1. **Domain Shift:** The visual appearance of the same object can vary greatly across domains, like between a photo and a sketch.  
2. **Semantic Shift:** The set of object classes can also change, so the model needs to generalize to unseen categories.

Existing methods struggle to handle both domain and semantic shifts simultaneously, especially when new domains or classes appear at test time.

---

## **Slide 3: Problem Statement**

**Script:**  
The goal of UCDR is to retrieve semantically similar images from a gallery, regardless of their domain, given a query image.  
The main challenges are:  
- **Generalization to Unseen Domains:** The model should work well even on domains it hasn’t seen during training.  
- **Generalization to Unseen Classes:** It should also handle new object categories at test time.

This makes UCDR much harder than traditional retrieval tasks, which usually assume fixed domains and classes.

---

## **Slide 4: Existing Methods & Their Limitations**

**Script:**  
Let’s briefly review existing approaches:  
- **Fine-tuning:** Adapts pre-trained models to new data, but requires lots of labeled data and struggles with unseen domains or classes.
- **Prompt-tuning:** Adds learnable prompts to pre-trained language-vision models like CLIP, but typically only adapts to specific domains or classes, not both.

Moreover, most prior work focuses on either domain adaptation or open-set recognition, but not both together. This is where ProS comes in.

---

## **Slide 5: ProS – High-Level Overview**

**Script:**  
ProS stands for Prompting-to-simulate Generalized Knowledge.  
It’s a two-stage framework designed to handle both domain and semantic shifts.  
Here’s the big picture:  
1. **Prompt Unit Learning (PUL):** Learns prompt units for general, domain-specific, and class-specific knowledge.
2. **Context-aware Simulator Learning (CSL):** Simulates the absence of certain domains or classes during training to mimic test-time scenarios.

A key novelty is the **mask-and-align strategy**, which ensures only relevant prompts are updated for each image.

## **Slide 6: ProS – Prompt Unit Learning (PUL)**

**Script:**  
Let’s dive deeper into Prompt Unit Learning.  
Each prompt is composed of three parts:  
- **General Prompt ($p_g$):** Captures knowledge shared across all domains and classes.
- **Domain Prompt ($p_{d_i}$):** Encodes domain-specific characteristics.
- **Class Prompt ($p_{c_j}$):** Encodes class-specific semantics.

Mathematically, the prompt for an image from domain $i$ and class $j$ is:  
$$
p_{i,j} = p_g + p_{d_i} + p_{c_j}
$$

The mask-and-align strategy ensures that only the relevant domain and class prompts are updated for each training sample, making learning more efficient and focused.

---

## **Slide 7: ProS – Context-aware Simulator Learning (CSL)**

**Script:**  
The second stage is Context-aware Simulator Learning.  
Here, ProS simulates test-time scenarios by randomly masking out some domain and class prompts during training.  
This is inspired by meta-learning:  
- The model learns to generalize by “pretending” some domains or classes are unseen during training.
- The simulator network tries to generate features as if those prompts were missing.

The loss function for simulator learning is:  
$$
\mathcal{L}_{sim} = \| f_{sim}(x) - f_{real}(x) \|^2
$$
where $f_{sim}(x)$ is the simulated feature and $f_{real}(x)$ is the actual feature.

This process helps the model handle new domains and classes at test time.

---

## **Slide 8: Evaluation Protocols**

**Script:**  
ProS is evaluated under three challenging protocols:  
1. **UCDR:** Both domains and classes seen during training.
2. **$U^c$CDR:** Unseen classes, but seen domains at test time.
3. **$U^d$CDR:** Unseen domains, but seen classes at test time.

These protocols test the model’s ability to generalize to new domains, new classes, or both.

---

## **Slide 9: Experimental Setup**

**Script:**  
Experiments are conducted on the DomainNet dataset, which contains six diverse domains: Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch.

The main evaluation metrics are:  
- **Precision@k:** Measures how many of the top-k retrieved images are correct.
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP@k):** Averages precision across all queries.

These metrics are standard for retrieval tasks and reflect both accuracy and ranking quality.

---

## **Slide 10: Baselines**

**Script:**  
ProS is compared against several strong baselines:  
- **SnMpNet:** A state-of-the-art cross-domain retrieval method.
- **SASA:** Focuses on semantic alignment.
- **CLIP-Full:** Fine-tunes the entire CLIP model.
- **CoOp and VPT:** Prompt-tuning methods for vision-language models.

These baselines represent the best existing approaches for UCDR.

---

## **Slide 11: Results & Comparisons**

**Script:**  
Here are the results.  
ProS outperforms all baselines across all three protocols, especially in the most challenging settings with unseen domains or classes.

For example, in the $U^d$CDR protocol, ProS achieves a significant improvement in mAP and Precision@k, demonstrating its superior generalization.

Importantly, ProS achieves this with only about 12.8% additional parameters compared to full fine-tuning, making it both effective and efficient.

---

## **Slide 12: Ablation Studies**

**Script:**  
Ablation studies show the importance of each component:  
- Removing the mask-and-align strategy or simulator learning leads to noticeable drops in performance.
- Varying the prompt length and number of transformer layers also affects results. The optimal prompt length is 16, and two transformer layers work best.

This validates the design choices in ProS.

---

## **Slide 13: Qualitative Analysis**

**Script:**  
Here are some qualitative results.  
- The t-SNE visualizations show that ProS produces well-clustered feature spaces, with images from the same class and different domains grouped together.
- Retrieval examples demonstrate that ProS can successfully find relevant images across domains, even for unseen classes or domains.

The feature space clustering is quantified using the metric  
$$
\sigma = \frac{\max D_{intra}}{\min D_{inter}}
$$  
where lower values indicate better clustering.

---

## **Slide 14: Limitations & Future Work**

**Script:**  
While ProS is effective, it has some limitations:  
- Performance can drop on domains with low-quality or highly abstract images, like Quickdraw or Infograph.
- The method assumes access to domain and class labels during training.

Future work could explore unsupervised domain discovery or adaptation to even more diverse domains.

---

## **Slide 15: Real-World Impact**

**Script:**  
ProS has significant real-world applications, such as:  
- Cross-modal content retrieval in e-commerce, where products may appear as photos, sketches, or illustrations.
- Recommendation systems that need to generalize to new product categories or styles.
- Digital asset management across creative industries.

Its ability to handle unseen domains and classes makes it highly practical for dynamic, real-world scenarios.

---

## **Slide 16: Conclusion**

**Script:**  
To summarize:  
- ProS introduces a novel prompt-based framework for universal cross-domain retrieval.
- It effectively handles both domain and semantic shifts through prompt unit learning and context-aware simulator learning.
- ProS outperforms strong baselines while being parameter-efficient and robust to new domains and classes.
